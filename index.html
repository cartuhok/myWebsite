  <p> Please allow me to introduce myself. I currently work at <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/">WGBH</a>. They make some of my favorite shows like <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/">Frontline</a> and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/">NOVA</a>. You should watch them. You should donate to PBS and NPR. I&#39;ll help keep the data sorted when you do. </p> <br>
  <p>I also like to think a lot about design. My mom is an interior designer and my dad is an architect so it runs in the family. I like to design things you see on your screen, mostly websites.  If you need help with one <a href="mailto:carter.m.rink@gmail.com">drop me a line.</a></p>

  <p>There's a lot to be said about design and code.  This is where I share my thoughts on those subjects.  Join me as I write about CSS, JavaScript, design, frameworks, and web trends. I also write about projects I've worked on and things I've learned along the way. </p>

  <p>I&#39;ll get around to updating this part of my site.  Probably when I&#39;m less busy making other sites.  For now, here&#39;s some links to a few projects and clients I&#39;ve worked with.</p>
